# airplane-cabin-digital-twin
A beginner-level digital twin project that simulates environmental conditions in an airplane cabin. The idea came as a fun experiment but can grow into a useful simulation of how digital twins can help improve cabin safety, passenger comfort, and system efficiency through real-time environmental monitoring.
